# ToDo by KMC
This is my todo app! It was built with React Native and other packages. So far it contains only CRUD with not much additional features. I'm going to add them more in future versions of this app. 

## How to use it?
My app allows you to create a **project**. Project contains some basic stuff like title, description, date, time etc. But there are also **tasks**. Tasks are smaller elements of the project. For example if you want to do the laundry (project), you have to check which clothes require washing, set up the washing machine, and hang the laundry (tasks).

## Features
So far my app contains this features:
- CRUD - the core of the apllication
- The possibility to mark project as completed
- tasks system - the possibility to declare smaller elements of the project
